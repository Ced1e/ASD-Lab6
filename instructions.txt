2. Format the font style and sizes. Use consistent font settings, with
distinct sizes and weights for headings and body text.

styles and alignment.

Layout Requirements
4. Use a 3-column layout for the main content area.

5. Format the header and footer. Align the header (including the
logo) with the About USeP section for consistent layout alignment.
Ensure the footer spans the full width of the page and that its text
is centered horizontally.


6. The layout must remain centered on the screen even when the
page is zoomed in or out.


7. Apply proper spacing, padding and alignment for readability.
